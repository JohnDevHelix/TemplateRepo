# Restaurant-Page

A simple restaurant page for a local food stall. One of TOP's projects. The Home page will show the details and history of the restaraunt, few items under Menu and contact details in Contact Us page.

Created page using what I've learned so far. Use of classes, factory functions, module pattern, webpack and npm.
